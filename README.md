# Portfolio Website CDM
 This is my final project for my Composing Digital Media course at the University of Pittsburgh. This portfolio project contains the two projects we worked on this semester. The first project is an audio narrative about the life of Michael Jackson. The second project is a video essay that covers my take on how social media has affected our society today.
